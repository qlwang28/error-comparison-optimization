– This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch:  I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service, so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed.####This=O review=O is=O for=O the=O Southglen=O location=O which=O is=O not=O listed=O in=O Citysearch=O ,=O I=O wish=O this=O review=O would=O make=O a=O difference=O enough=O for=O it=O to=O be=O addressed=O by=O management=O but=O Snooze=O has=O people=O climbing=O over=O each=O other=O for=O a=O chance=O to=O eat=O at=O this=O overpriced=O restaurant=O with=O mediocre=O food=O and=O service=O ,=O so=O this=O review=O as=O well=O as=O the=O other=O negative=O ones=O for=O their=O Larimer=O location=O will=O go=O unaddressed=O .=O
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.####The=O presentation=O of=O Snooze=T-POS is=O excellent=O and=O it=O is=O one=O of=O those=O places=O that=O you=O feel=O more=O sophisticated=O just=O for=O being=O there=O ;=O but=O peel=O back=O the=O layers=O and=O you=O have=O an=O overpriced=O IHOP=O with=O a=O high=O brow=O menu=T-NEG .=O
To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.####To=O start=O off=O ,=O approximately=O 8-10=O oz=O of=O orange=T-NEG juice=T-NEG will=O cost=O you=O $=O 3=O .=O
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.####They=O serve=O it=O in=O a=O tall=O ,=O skinny=O hour-glass=O shaped=O glass=O to=O disguise=O the=O fact=O that=O you=O a=O getting=O a=O small=O juice=T-NEG at=O the=O price=O of=O a=O half=O gallon=O in=O a=O supermarket=O .=O
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.####I=O should=O have=O just=O asked=O for=O the=O check=O when=O I=O saw=O that=O ;=O but=O their=O menu=T-POS was=O so=O unique=O that=O I=O continued=O .=O
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.####The=O pancakes=T-POS were=O certainly=O inventive=O but=O $=O 850=O for=O 3=O ,=O 6=O pancakes=T-POS one=O of=O them=O was=O more=O like=O 5=O in=O the=O pancake=O flight=O sample=O of=O 3=O different=O pancakes=T-POS is=O well=O over-priced=O .=O
The pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.####The=O pancakes=T-NEG should=O be=O larger=O at=O least=O 8=O to=O justify=O the=O expense=O even=O with=O the=O unique=O offerings=O .=O
The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.####The=O flavors=O were=O good=O but=O I=O have=O had=O far=O better=O pancakes=O at=O a=O German=O pancake=O specialty=O restaurant=O that=O were=O a=O little=O cheaper=O but=O significan'tly=O larger=O .=O
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.####On=O my=O meal=T-NEG I=O had=O to=O send=O back=O my=O eggs=T-NEG for=O a=O simple=O request=O of=O breaking=O the=O yokes=O before=O cooking=O ,=O and=O would=O have=O had=O to=O send=O them=O back=O again=O if=O I=O had=O n't=O rejected=O the=O meal=T-NEG all=O together=O .=O
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.####I=O rejected=O it=O because=O in=O the=O process=O of=O attempting=O to=O fix=O the=O eggs=O they=O broke=O something=O else=O in=O the=O dish=T-NEG and=O I=O was=O too=O frustrated=O to=O continue=O .=O
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.####To=O their=O credit=O they=O removed=O the=O dish=O from=O the=O check=O ;=O but=O no=O manager=T-NEG stopped=O by=O to=O ask=O what=O the=O problem=O was=O .=O
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).####In=O the=O end=O our=O check=O came=O to=O $=O 27=O for=O 4=O small=O pancakes=T-NEG ,=O a=O breakfast=T-NEG burrito=T-NEG ,=O an=O orange=T-NEG juice=T-NEG and=O an=O iced=T-NEG tea=T-NEG I=O had=O water=O .=O

Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####Ray=O 's=O is=O something=O of=O a=O Seattle=O institution=O ,=O but=O given=O its=O gorgeous=O Sound=T-POS views=T-POS ,=O I=O had=O suspected=O that=O the=O accolades=O were=O more=O due=O to=O the=O scenery=O than=O to=O the=O food=O and=O service=O .=O

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####My=O party=O of=O two=O was=O feeling=O particularly=O ambitious=O ,=O and=O we=O splurged=O on=O the=O Shilshole=T-POS Sampler=T-POS beautiful=O assortment=O of=O enormous=O white=T-POS gulf=T-POS prawns=T-POS ,=O smoked=O albacore=O tuna=O ,=O Ray=O 's=O fantastic=O manila=T-POS clams=T-POS seasoned=O with=O dill=O ,=O scallops=O in=O a=O tasty=O soy=T-POS dressing=T-POS ,=O and=O a=O tiny=O pile=O of=O Dungeness=O crab=O atop=O a=O sublime=O butter=T-POS sauce=T-POS .=O
